COPIED FROM THEWIZARDS!!!! This namespaces provides Dependency Injection functionality.
The static access point is DI. It can be used to resolve interfaces to instances.
A DependencyBindings object can be used to set the current bindings. This is a scoped-singleton pattern (service pattern) so these bindings can be swapped in runtime.

Namespaces providing Interfaces that are meant for dependency injection are required to bind a default dependency :) ( is this actually posssible? )
