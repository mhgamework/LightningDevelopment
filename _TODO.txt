Use GITSharp http://www.eqqon.com/index.php/GitSharp

Write program that uses git fetch and self-updates from the git repository.
Write a watcher that automatically commits and pushed the LightningDevelopment folders.
Add utility that gives a quicklauncher with buttons or a list of actions, context sensitive (like commit etc).
Maybe add machine learning?
Watch user activity (eg using visual studio for 2 mins) and then ask for toggle updates and such.
